# Nedyalko Draganov - My website and Portfolio

## How i deployed my website

* Git Bash - I used Git Bash for creating the project with repository and initial<br/>
 commitment.
* Visual Studio Code - I used it for code editor throught creation of the whole project.
* Internet Browser Search - for searching of icons, fonts, colours and code solutions.
* GitHub Desktop - I used it for regulary commitments to the repository in GitHub website.
* GitHub Pages - I used it for deployment (I have done it at early stage of creation of the project<br/>
  for easy and better check of the page's layout (responsiveness) on an actual mobile device):
  - I opened my project repository "My-Web-Page" in GitHub website
  - Then i pressed "Settings" button
  - Scrolled down and pressed "Pages" button
  - Under "Source" I choosed "Branch-main, Folder-/(root)
  - Then and finally step i pressed "Save" button
